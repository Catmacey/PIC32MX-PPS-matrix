PPS matrix for PIC32MX series

These spreadsheets are intended to help work out how best to distribute your peripherals in the PIC32MX series.

The PIC32MX series has a much more limited implementation of PPS as compared to that found in the PIC24 series.

Most peripherals can be remapped tp some degree, but only to a sub-set of GPIO and some cannot be remapped at all (Such as the SPI CLKs).
This differs from the PIC24 series where you can map pretty much any peripheral to any of the remappable GPIOs.

So far I've only worked with the PIC32MX150f128b so that's the only document here right now.
